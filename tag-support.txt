We just launched a new feature for both lists.sh[0] and prose.sh[1] that allows bloggers to add tags to their posts.
=> https://lists.sh lists[0]
=> https://prose.sh prose[1]

When tags are added to a post, users can see the tags on a post. When a user clicks on a tag, it will take them to the writers main blog page, filtering posts by the tag.

Right now we only support filtering posts by a single tag, but we want to hear from you if you'd like to filter by multiple tags.

Filtering by tag is also supported for RSS feeds
=> /rss?tag=feature rss?tag=feature

This feature was important for us to implement because we are going to leverage tagging for a new service we are building `imgs.sh` which is a premium image hosting service. Creating photo albums will created by tagging images. Since we are implementing it for `imgs.sh` we decided to back port it to `prose.sh` and `lists.sh`.

We are beginning to bear fruit for our monorepo architecture that we discussed in our previous status update post[2].
